# Le Rail

Robots like the [SO-101](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101) often benefit from some kind of rigging or workspaces - ways to hold cameras, lights, parts.

This project gives you a way to build simple, cheap structures for holding things with the ethos of cheap, modular, adaptable parts for budget robotics projects.

## Supplies
- 3/4" PVC tubing - cheap and easily available (at least in US hardware stores)
- Drywall screws
- For camera clamp: 
    - 1/4"-20 buttonhead bolts
    - 1/4"-20 threaded inserts for 3D printed

## Tools
- Some way to cut PVC tubing. A dedicated cutter is a good idea.
- Some way to chamfer the tubing or sand down the cuts
