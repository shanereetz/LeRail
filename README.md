Robots like the [SO-101](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101) often benefit from some kind of rigging or workspaces - ways to hold cameras, lights, parts.

This project gives you a way to build simple, cheap structures for holding things with the ethos of cheap, modular, adaptable parts for budget robotics projects.

## Models

| Image | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ![Junction](images/junction.png) | **Junction** - A simple plus-shaped piece that allows you to connect 2-4 pieces of tubing together. |
| ![Base](images/base.png) | **Base** - A base for securing tubing to floors, walls or other surfaces. |
| ![Camera Clamp](images/camera_1.png) | **Camera Clamp** - A clamp for securing a camera to the junction. Uses threaded inserts designed for 1/4"-20 bolts commonly used on cameras. |
| ![Camera Clamp Part 2](images/camera_2.png) | **Camera Clamp Part 2** - Additional view of the camera clamp assembly. |

## Supplies
- 3/4" PVC tubing - cheap and easily available (at least in US hardware stores)
- Drywall screws
- For camera clamp: 
    - 1/4"-20 buttonhead bolts
    - 1/4"-20 threaded inserts for 3D printed

## Tools
- Some way to cut PVC tubing. A hacksaw works in a pinchbut the dedicated PVC cutters are easiest.
- Some way to chamfer the tubing or sand down the cuts
